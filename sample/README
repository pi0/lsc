This directory contains a fully configured demonstration for LSC.

This demonstration comes with some sample data, in a CSV file, to be loaded into
a simple SQL database table, and synchronized to a directory.

Both the database (HSQLDB) and the directory (OpenDS) are included as
dependencies of LSC, and will be launched automatically.
